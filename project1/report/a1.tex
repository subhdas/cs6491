\section{Objective}

To simulate the precise motion of a large number of balls in a cube in computer graphics. 

\section{Input}
We are given the intial prositions and velocities of $n$ balls. We have the following assumptions: All balls are in the cube, have the same radius and mass, and are pairwise disjoint. Balls starts in constant velocity motion. All collisions are elastic.


\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Elastic collision law}
Elastic collision preserves the total energy and momentum. So 
for collisions between ball and wall 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:collisionBW}
  V'_{\perp} = - V_{\perp} \,,\quad V'_{\parallel} = V_{\parallel}
\end{equation}
and collision between ball and ball
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:collisionBB}
  & V'_{1, \perp} = V_{1, \perp} \,,\quad V'_{2, \perp} = V_{2, \perp} \\
  & V'_{1, \parallel} = V_{2, \parallel} \,,\quad V'_{2, \parallel} = V_{1, \parallel}
\end{align}
Here, subscript $\perp$ denotes the direction perpendicular to the
center-center line, and $\parallel$ denotes the direction along the
center-center
line.

\subsection{Key Classes and Methods}
We implement new classes and methods for $balls$ class, some of which are:

\subsubsection{class Colli}
A class used to store collision object and time. It has two variables: $p$ denotes the index of ball to collide, and $t$ is the collision time.

\subsubsection{Colli[] colli}
An array to store next collisions of all balls with balls or walls (where walls are denoted by negative integers).

\subsubsection{void initPointsOnGrid()}
A modified version of ball collisions to help debugging.

\subsubsection{float calB2BTime()}
Calculate the collision time between two balls. If two balls cannot collide in positive finite time, the return -1. We solved the quadratic equation with regard to $P_0$, $P_1$, $V_0$, $V_1$, $r$, $t$ to get the minimal collision time.

\subsubsection{float calB2WTime()}
Calculate the collision time between one ball and one wall. If they cannot collide in positive finite time, then return -1. We solve linear equation with regard to $P_0$, $V_0$, $r$, $R$, $t$ to get the minimal collision time.

\subsubsection{Colli calOneBallColli()}
Calculate the smallest collision time between ball i and other balls and walls. This function checks all possibilities between one ball and all the other balls, and all six walls. A minimum collision time is maintained along with the next collision object (a ball or a wall). The complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of balls.

\subsubsection{void initCollision()}
Initialize the collision array by calculating next collision of all balls. This complexity is $O(n^2)$. Luckily we only need to do it once in initialization phase. 

\subsubsection{void bounceTwoBalls()}
Solve two balls' velocities after collision. Normal compatible components (along the line conneting these two balls) will exchange. 

\subsubsection{void updateB2BColli()}
We calculate the velocities of two balls after collisions, then update the next collisions of these two balls. We also need to update balls that ``WERE going to collide into these two balls'', and balls that ``ARE supposed to collide into these two balls''. All the rest do not need to recalculate. In the first case, since the initial velocities of all balls are randomized, the expected number of collisions for a ball with other balls is $nP$, $n$ is the number of balls, and $P$ is the probability of collision, which is proportional to $r$, where $r$ is inversely proportional to $n$. Therefore, the number of collision is O(1). In the second case, it is clearly no more than two. Therefore, the complexity is $O(n)$.

\subsubsection{void updateB2WColli()}
We calculate the velocities of the ball after collision with a wall, then update the next collisions of this ball. We also need to update balls that ``WERE going to collide into this ball'', and the ball that ``IS supposed to collide into this ball''. All the rest do not need to recalculate. The complexity is $O(n)$.

\subsubsection{void updateColli()}
The main function to update the state whenever collision is about to happen. Update collision array using either one of the update functions.

\subsection{General Picture}

\subsubsection{Initialization Phase: Before the graphic process begins}
After adding balls to the scene, we call $initCollisions()$ to initialize collision array $colli[]$.


\subsubsection{Update Phase: At each frame of the graphic process}
We call updateColli() to update collision array if next collision is about to happen.


\section{Complexity/Performance}
$O(n^2)$ for pairwise comparison in the initialization phase, and $O(n)$ in the update phase.


\section{Experimental results and analysis}

\subsection{Numerical Setup}
\nbs * \nbs * \nbs\ balls are initialized in a cubic 
frame with each side has \nbs\ balls. Simulations are conducted 
with increasing \nbs\ until the simulation time in each frame exceeds
a single frame time (1/20 second). Sphere detail is set to 6 and 
sphere radius is given by formula
\[
  r = \frac{w}{(30\pi)^{1/3} *\, nbs}
\] 
All experimental data is taken every 5 frames with 50 samples
for each \nbs.

\subsection{Maximal \nbs}
Fig~\ref{fig:time} shows the average time for 4 different stages, among
which, $t_{12}$ is the time used to update the collision information 
(physical process) and $t_{34}$ is the time to draw all balls (graphical
process). As we can see, \textbf{the maximal \nbs\ that our simulation can
sustain is 11}. At this \nbs, $t_{01}\simeq 23\%$ and $t_{34}\simeq 18\%$.

\textbf{Why the computation time is super linear ?} 
As we can see in Fig~\ref{fig:time},  $t_{01}$ is not linear with respect
to the number of balls (\nbs\ * nbs\ * \nbs). However, this phenomenon 
does not contradict 
our claim that the updating complexity is $O(n)$, because, with increasing
\nbs, the number of collisions per frame increases. Therefore, the work
needed to update collision information in each frame is super linear. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  (a)\includegraphics[width=0.46\textwidth]{nbsTime}
  (b)\includegraphics[width=0.46\textwidth]{nbs3Time}
  \caption{$t_{01}$, $t_{12}$, $t_{23}$ and $t_{34}$ with respect to \nbs 
    (a) and the number of balls (b) respectively.}
  \label{fig:time}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Number of collisions per frame}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  (a)\includegraphics[width=0.46\textwidth]{collision}
  (a)\includegraphics[width=0.46\textwidth]{analytic}
  \caption{
    (a) Averaged number of collisions per frame for different \nbs.
    (b) number of collision per frame vs $\nbs^4$. The blue curve is
    experimental result. Red dashed line is the analytical relation
    formula \eqref{eq:2} : $ y = 0.00486 \, x$.
  }
  \label{fig:collision}
\end{figure}
First, we give a analytical formula for this 
relation. First, the average free flight time is estimated as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  t \propto \frac{w}{\nbs\, * v} \,,
\end{equation}
where, $w$ is the cube length and $v$ is the average velocity.
Second, during this period, the number of collisions happened should 
be proportional to the number of balls, which is $\nbs^3$. So, the 
number of collisions per frame is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \# collsions \propto \frac{v}{wf} * \nbs^4
\end{equation}
Here, $f$ is the frame rate. 
\textbf{Basically, the collision number per frame is
proportional to $\nbs^4$.}

Fig~\ref{fig:collision}(a) shows relation between number of collisions 
per frame versus \nbs with error bars. Panel (b) compares the experimental
data with an analytical relation $ y = 0.00486 \, x$ (Note, the x axis is
$\nbs^4$ in (b) ). We see that these two match every well.


\section{Conclusion}
We have simulated the collective motion of a large number of 
elastic balls in a
cubic container. The maximal \nbs\ that our simulation
can support is 11. Also, we found the
number of collisions per frame is proportional to $\nbs^4$ both
analytically and experimentally.

%\section{Principal Component Analysis [20 pts]}
%In class, we learned that Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
%preserves variance as much as possible. We are going to explore
%another way of deriving it: minimizing reconstruction error.
%
%Consider data points $\text x^n (n=1, ..., N)$ in $D$-dimensional space.
%We are going to represent them in $\{\text u_1, ..., \text u_D\}$ orthonormal basis.
%That is,
%\begin{equation} \nonumber
%\text x^n = \sum_{i=1}^D \alpha_i^n \text u_i = \sum_{i=1}^D ({\text x^n}^T \text u_i) \text u_i.
%\end{equation}
%Here, $\alpha^n_i$ is the length when $\text x^n$ is projected onto
%$u_i$.
%
%Suppose we want to reduce the dimension from $D$ to $M < D$. Then
%the data point $\text x^n$ is approximated by
%\begin{equation} \nonumber
%\tilde{\text x}^n = \sum_{i=1}^M z_i^n \text u_i + \sum_{i=M+1}^D b_i \text u_i.
%\end{equation}
%In this representation, the first $M$ directions of $\text u_i$ are
%allowed to have different coefficient $z^n_i$ for each data point,
%while the rest has a constant coefficient $b_i$. As long as it is
%the same value for all data points, it does not need to be 0.
%
%Our goal is setting $\text u_i$, $z^n_i$, and $b_i$ for $n = 1,..., N$
%and $i = 1, ..., D$ so as to minimize reconstruction error. That is,
%we want to minimize the difference between $\text x^n$ and $\tilde{\text x}^n$ over $\{ \text u_i, z^n_i, b_i \}$:
%\begin{equation} \nonumber
%J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \| \text x^n - \tilde{\text x}^n \|^2.
%\end{equation}
%
%\subsubsection*{(a) What is the assignment of $z_j^n$ for $j=1, ..., M$ minimizing $J$? [5 pts]}
%\subsubsection*{(b) What is the assignment of $b_j$ for $j=M+1, ..., D$ minimizing $J$? [5 pts]}
%\subsubsection*{(c) Express optimal $\tilde{\text x}^n$ and $\text x^n - \tilde{\text x}^n$ using your answer for (a) and (b). [2 pts]}
%\subsubsection*{(d) What should be the $\text u_i$ for $i=1, ..., D$ to minimize $J$? [8 pts]}
%
%\emph{Hint:} Use $S = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N (\text x^n - \bar{\text x})(\text x^n -
%\bar{\text x})^T$ for sample covariance matrix. \vspace{1cm}
%
%

%\section{Clustering [20 pts]}
%
%\textbf{[a-b]} Given $N$ data points $\text x^n (n=1,\dots,N)$, $K$-means clustering algorithm groups them into $K$ clusters by minimizing the distortion function over $\{ r^{nk}, \mu^k \}$
%$$J=\sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^Kr^{nk} \|\text x^n-\mu^k\|^2,$$
%where $r^{nk}=1$ if $\text x^n$ belongs to the $k$-th cluster and $r^{nk}=0$ otherwise.
%
%\subsubsection*{(a) Prove that using the squared Euclidean distance $\|\text x^n-\mu^k\|^2$ as the dissimilarity function and minimizing the distortion function, we will have 
%   $$\mu^k=\frac{\sum_n r^{nk} \text x_n}{\sum_n r^{nk}}.$$
%   That is, $\mu^k$ is the center of $k$-th cluster. [5 pts]}
%
%\subsubsection*{(b) Prove that $K$-means algorithm converges to a local optimum in finite steps. [5 pts]}
%
%
%\textbf{[c-d]} In class, we discussed bottom-up hierarchical clustering. For each iteration, we need to find two clusters $\{\text x_1, \text x_2, \dots, \text x_m\}$ and $\{\text y_1, \text y_2, \dots, \text y_p\}$ with the minimum distance to merge. Some of the most commonly used distance metrics between two clusters are:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Single linkage: the minimum distance between any pairs of points from the two clusters, i.e.
%    $$\min_{i=1,\dots,m \atop j=1,\dots, p}\|\text x_i - \text y_j\|$$
%    \item Complete linkage: the maximum distance between any parts of points from the two clusters, i.e.
%    $$\max_{i=1,\dots,m \atop j=1,\dots, p}\|\text x_i - \text y_j\|$$
%    \item Average linkage: the average distance between all pair of points from the two clusters, i.e.
%    $$\frac{1}{mp}\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^p\|\text x_i - \text y_j\|$$
%    \end{itemize}
%
%\subsubsection*{(c) When we use the bottom up hierarchical clustering to realize the partition of data, which of the three cluster distance metrics described above would most likely result in clusters most similar to those given by $K$-means? (Suppose $K$ is a power of 2 in this case). [5 pts]}
%
%\subsubsection*{(d) For the following data (two moons), which of these three distance metrics (if any) would successfully separate the two moons? [5 pts]}

%\section{Programming: Image compression [30 pts]}
%
%In this programming assignment, you are going to apply clustering algorithms for image compression. Before starting this assignment, we strongly recommend reading PRML Section 9.1.1, page 428 -- 430.
%
%To ease your implementation, we provide a skeleton code containing image processing part. \texttt{homework1.m} is designed to read an RGB bitmap image file, then cluster pixels with the given number of clusters $K$. It shows converted image only using $K$ colors, each of them with the representative color of centroid. To see what it looks like, you are encouraged to run \texttt{homework1(`beach.bmp', 3)} or \texttt{homework1(`football.bmp', 2)}, for example.
%
%Your task is implementing the clustering parts with two algorithms: \emph{$K$-means} and \emph{$K$-medoids}. We learned and demonstrated $K$-means in class, so you may start from the sample code we distributed.
%
%The file you need to edit is \texttt{mykmeans.m} and \texttt{mykmedoids.m}, provided with this homework. In the files, you can see it calls Matlab function \texttt{kmeans} initially. Comment this line out, and implement your own in the files. You would expect to see similar result with your implementation of $K$-means, instead of \texttt{kmeans} function in Matlab.
%
%\subsubsection*{$K$-medoids}
%
%In class, we learned that the basic $K$-means works in Euclidean space for computing distance between data points as well as for updating centroids by arithmetic mean. Sometimes, however, the dataset may work better with other distance measures. It is sometimes even impossible to compute arithmetic mean if a feature is categorical, e.g, gender or nationality of a person. With $K$-medoids, you choose a representative data point for each cluster instead of computing their average.
%
%Given $N$ data points $\text x^n (n = 1, ..., N)$, $K$-medoids clustering algorithm groups them into $K$ clusters by minimizing the distortion function $J = \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K r^{nk} D(\text x^n, \mu^k)$,
%where $D(\text x, \text y)$ is a distance measure between two vectors $\text x$ and $\text y$ in same size (in case of $K$-means, $D(x, y) = \| \text x - \text y \|^2$), $\mu^k$ is the center of $k$-th cluster; and $r^{nk} = 1$ if $\text x^n$ belongs to the $k$-th cluster and $r^{nk} = 0$ otherwise. In this exercise, we will use the following iterative procedure:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Initialize the cluster center $\mu^k$, $k = 1, ..., K$.
%  \item Iterate until convergence:
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item Update the cluster assignments for every data point $\text x^n$: $r^{nk} = 1$ if $k = \argmin_j D(\text x^n, \mu^j)$, and $r^{nk} = 0$ otherwise.
%    \item Update the center for each cluster $k$: choosing another representative if necessary.
%  \end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
%
%There can be many options to implement the procedure; for example, you can try many distance measures in addition to Euclidean distance, and also you can be creative for deciding a better representative of each cluster. We will not restrict these choices in this assignment. You are encouraged to try many distance measures as well as way of choosing representatives.
%
%
%\subsubsection*{Formatting instruction}
%
%Both \texttt{mykmeans.m} and \texttt{mykmedoids.m} take input and output format as follows. You should not alter this definition, otherwise your submission will print an error, which leads to zero credit.\\
%
%\textbf{Input}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item \texttt{pixels}: the input image representation. Each row contains one data point (pixel). For image dataset, it contains 3 columns, each column corresponding to Red, Green, and Blue component. Each component has an integer value between 0 and 255.
%  \item \texttt{K}: the number of desired clusters. Too high value of $K$ may result in empty cluster error. Then, you need to reduce it.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\textbf{Output}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item \texttt{class}: cluster assignment of each data point in pixels. The assignment should be 1, 2, 3, etc. For $K = 5$, for example, each cell of class should be either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The output should be a column vector with \texttt{size(pixels, 1)} elements.
%  \item \texttt{centroid}: location of $K$ centroids (or representatives) in your result. With images, each centroid corresponds to the representative color of each cluster. The output should be a matrix with $K$ rows and 3 columns. The range of values should be [0, 255], possibly floating point numbers.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsubsection*{Hand-in}
%Both of your code and report will be evaluated. Upload \texttt{mykmeans.m} and \texttt{mykmedoids.m} files with your implementation. In your report, answer to the following questions:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Within the $K$-medoids framework, you have several choices for detailed implementation. Explain how you designed and implemented details of your $K$-medoids algorithm, including (but not limited to) how you chose representatives of each cluster, what distance measures you tried and chose one, or when you stopped iteration.
%  \item Attach a picture of your own. We recommend size of $320 \times 240$ or smaller.
%  \item Run your $K$-medoids implementation with the picture you chose above, with several different $K$. (e.g, small values like 2 or 3, large values like 16 or 32) What did you observe with different $K$? How long does it take to converge for each $K$?
%  \item Run your $K$-medoids implementation with different initial centroids/representatives. Does it affect final result? Do you see same or different result for each trial with different initial assignments? (We usually randomize initial location of centroids in general. To answer this question, an intentional poor assignment may be useful.)
%  \item Repeat question 2 and 3 with $K$-means. Do you see significant difference between $K$-medoids and $K$-means, in terms of output quality, robustness, or running time?
%\end{enumerate}
%
%
%\subsubsection*{Note}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item You may see some error message about empty clusters even with Matlab implementation, when you use too large $K$. Your implementation should treat this exception as well. That is, do not terminate even if you have an empty cluster, but use smaller number of clusters in that case.
%
%  \item We will grade using test pictures which are not provided. We recommend you to test your code with several different pictures so that you can detect some problems that might happen occasionally. 
%
%  \item If we detect copy from any other student's code or from the web, you will not be eligible for any credit for the entire homework, not just for the programming part. Also, directly calling Matlab function \texttt{kmeans} or other clustering functions is not allowed.
